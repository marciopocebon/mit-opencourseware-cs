statistical thinking

- how many samples do we need to believe the answer / the result of a random test?
  - notion of variance
    "measure of how much spread there is in possible outcomes"
  - standard deviation
    "measures the fraction of values that are close to the mean"
  - coefficient of variation
    "standard deviation / the mean"
    - cannot be used for cofidence intervals
- normal distribution (a.k.a. bell curve, gaus distribution)
  - always peaks at the mean
  - falls of symmetrically
  - has nice mathematical properties
    - characterised by the mean and standar deviation
      "which can be used to compute confidence intervals"
  - confidence interval
    - give us a range likely to contain unkown value
    - give us a confidence level that value lies within range
  - empirical rule
    "help us estimate the confidence interval given the mean and the standard deviation"
  - many naturally occuring examples
- standard error
  "estimates the standard deviation"
- check yourself
  - What does the standard deviation tell us?
    "It is a distance which describes the range +/- from the mean containing a particular fraction of the values; it describes the shape of the bell curve."
  - What is variance?
    "A measure of how much spread there is in the possible different outcomes."
  - What is the coefficient of variation?
    "The standard deviation divided by the mean. If it's less than 1, the distribution is considered low-variance."
