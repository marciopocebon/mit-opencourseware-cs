some basic probability and plotting data

- probability
  - the world is non-determinism because we can't actually predict it
  - causal non-determinism
    "not every event is caused by previousely events"
  - predictive non-determinism
    "our inability to make accurrate management about the physic world makes it impossible to make precise predictions about the future"
  - stochastic processes
    "next state depends on previous states & some random element"
  - what fraction of the possible results have the property we are testing for?
  - the probability of some event occurring has to be between 0 and 1
    - 0
      "cannot happen"
    - 1
      "guarantee to happen"
- plotting
  - pylab
  - matlab
  - matplatlib.sourgeforge.net
- check yourself
  - What is a stochastic process?
    "One whose next state depends upon both previous states and some random element."
  - What makes two events independent?
    "Two events are independent if the outcome of one has no influence on the outcome of the other."
