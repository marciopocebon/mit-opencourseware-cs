curve fitting

- physical reality
- theoretical model
- computational models
- objective function
  "help choosing the best fit for drawing a line between points"
- least squares fit
  "metodo dos minimos quadrados =D"
- polyfit
  "takes 3 arguments, observed x and y values and the degree of the polynomium"
  - returns some values to draw the line
  - minimizes the minimum square error
- coefficient of determination
  "the ratio of the estimated error and the variance in the measured data"
- check yourself
  - what is an objective function?
    "One that provides a quantitative assessment of how well the curve fits the data."
  - what does curve fitting do?
    "Relates an independent variable to an estimated value of a dependent variable."
  - What is the coefficient of determination?
    "Coefficient of determination, R^2, is equal to 1 â€“ (estimated error)/(variance of the actual data)"
