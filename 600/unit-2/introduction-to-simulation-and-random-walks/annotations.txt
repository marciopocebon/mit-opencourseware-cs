introduction to simularion and random walks

- check yourself
  - what is a generator?
    "A function that remembers the point in the function body where it last returned a value and the values of all local variables."
  - what is the difference between yield and return?
    "When yield is used, the state of the function is not lost."
  - what is a model?
    "A model is a theoretical construct that will provide useful information about the possible behaviors of the system being modeled."
- a generator
  - is a function that remembers the point in function body where last returned
  - examples
    - yield
- analytic methods
  "predict behaviour, given initial conditions and parameters"
- simulation methods
  "gives me a sense of what might happen to a system under some conditions"
  - systems not mathematical trackable
  - successively refining series of simulations
  - easier to abstract useful intermediate results
  - computes
  - how does it works
    - build a model
      - gives useful information about bahaviour of the system
      - approximation to reality
      - simulation models are descriptive, not prescriptive
    - brownian motion
