Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:
1. apply shift from 0 to 27 and use it to decode the text
2. count the number of valid words for each shift
3. stores the shift with the maximum number of words
4. return the shift
