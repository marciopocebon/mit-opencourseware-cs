machine learning

- how to build programs that learn
- inductive inference/reasoning
- unsupervised learning
  "regularities of data"
  - we have training data, but we dont have labels
  - clustering
    "the process of organizing the objects into groups whose members are similar in some way"
    - examples
      - in marketing, find groups of customers with similar behaviour
      - amazon: books recommendations
      - netflix: movies recommendations
    - what properties does a good clustering has?
      - low intra-cluster dissimilarity
        "all of the objects from the cluster should be similar by some metrics"
      - high inter-cluster dissimilarity
        "objects from the same cluster are similar, but two different objects from two different clusters are quite different from each other"
    - how to model dissimilarity? with variance!
      "variance (c) = ∑ [x in c] (mean(c) - x)**2"
    - badness
      "the combination of computing the dissimilarity of a intra and a inter cluster"
    - constraints
      - maximum number of clusters
      - maximum distance between clusters
      - etc.
    - greedy algorithms
      - k - means
      - hierarchical
        - agglomerative clustering (see slides) O(√N)
          "combining objects in clusters"
          - 1. assign each item to its own cluster
          - 2. find the most similar pair of clusters and merge them
            "we have to define it.. different metrics can be used to get different properties"
          - 3. continue to process
        - metrics
          - linkage criterion
            - single-linkage (see slides)
              "the shortest distance between any pair of objects/points and we say: that's the distance between the two clusters"
            - complete-linkage
              "the furthest distance between any pair of objects/points, the opposite from single-linkage"
            - average-linkage
              "take all of the distances, add them up and take the average"
          - feature selection
    - feature vector
      - incorporates multiple features
- supervised learning
  "associate a label with each example in a training set"
  - discrete
    "classification problem"
    - divide a training data by its color
      "red x blue (see lecture slides)"
  - real
    "regression problem"
  - questions to make when analysing a problem:
    - are the labels accurate?
      "ps: there is no guarantee that the labels are accurate"
    - is past representative of future?
    - do you have enough [training] data to generalize?
    - future extraction
    - how tight should the fit be?
- Check Yourself
  - What is machine learning?
    "A scientific discipline that is concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to evolve behaviors based on empirical data."
  - What is inductive inference?
    "The observation of examples that represent incomplete information about some statistical phenomenon in order to recognize complex patterns and make intelligent decisions."
  - What is supervised learning?
    "Learning in which a label is associated with each example in a training set."
  - What is unsupervised learning used for?
    "Uncovering hidden regularities or detecting anomalies in data."
  - What is clustering?
    "The process of organizing objects into groups whose members are similar in some way"
  - What is agglomerative clustering?
    "Clustering that merges clusters iteratively"
