using randomness to solve non-random problems

- uniform distributions
  "each result is equally probable"
- exponential distributions
  - memory-less
    "independent of previous outcome"
- analytical modeling
  "hard to adapt based on constraints"
- simulation modeling
  "easy to adapt based on constraints"
- check yourself
  - What is a Gaussian distribution?
    "Also known as a normal distribution, a Gaussian distribution is symmetric and can be fully characterized by its mean and standard deviation."
  - What is a uniform distribution?
    "One where each outcome has the same probability. The distribution can be fully characterized with a single parameter, the range."
  - What is important about an exponential distribution?
    "This is the only continuous memory-less distribution, meaning that the probability of any outcome at a point in time is independent of the outcome at any previous time.
